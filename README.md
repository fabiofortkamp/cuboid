# cuboid

Cuboid is my attempt of studying fluid and equilibrium-focused Thermodynamics [^1] using concepts from Domain-Driven Design[^2], and implemented in F# [^3]

To get started, take a look at [the fluid types module](Fluid.Types.fsx) and see if, without knowing F#, you can understand the main concepts behind classical thermodynamics.
